## 👋 Hi, I'm **Vaibhav Rathore**

I am an **MS by Research scholar at the Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (C-MInDS), IIT Bombay**, where I work on core problems in **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Generalizable Recognition Systems**.  

My research focuses on building models that **adapt across visual domains**, **discover unseen categories**, and remain **robust in open-world settings**. I am broadly interested in **Domain Generalization (DG)**, **Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)**, **Representation Learning**, and **Fine-Grained Recognition**.

---

## 🔬 **Research Overview**

My current research explores the fundamental question:

> *“How can we build vision systems that generalize to new domains and discover new categories without supervision?”*

I work at the intersection of:

- **Domain Generalization (DG)**
- **Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)**
- **Open-world and continual recognition**
- **Hyperbolic and geometry-aware representation learning**
- **Vision Transformers & generative models (VAE/GAN/GS)**  

My work has been accepted at **top-tier A\* venues** like **CVPR 2025** and **NeurIPS 2025**.

## 📝 **Selected Publications**

### **When Domain Generalization meets Generalized Category Discovery**  
**CVPR 2025 (A\*)**  
*Vaibhav Rathore, Shubhranil B., Saikat Dutta, Sarthak Mehrotra, Zsolt Kira, Biplab Banerjee*  
- Introduces **DG2CD-Net**, enabling models to adapt on the fly using episodic and synthetic domains.  
- Works even when training and testing domains are drastically different.

### **HIDISC: A Hyperbolic Framework for Domain Generalization with GCD**  
**NeurIPS 2025 (A\*)**  
*Vaibhav Rathore, Divyam Gupta, Biplab Banerjee*  
- Hyperbolic geometry–based DG-GCD model outperforming episodic baseline methods.  
- Eliminates synthetic domain generation while improving generalization.

### **FOCUS: Fine-Grained Recognition Meets Open-World Discovery**  
*Under Review @ CVPR 2026*

### **M3 Questioning: Multimodal, Multi-span Medical QA**
