## Self Projects

### AI Support Assistant (Samsung S25 Ultra Support)
*Built a Streamlit-based chatbot integrating RAG with PDF manuals.*
*   **Tech:** Qwen3-4B-Instruct, QLoRA, RAG, Streamlit
*   Fine-tuned **Qwen3-4B-Instruct** using **QLoRA** to adopt a patient and professional support persona.
*   Delivered **real-time, factual assistance** with reduced hallucinations and improved user satisfaction by integrating RAG with PDF manuals.

### Kinector: A Text-Conditioned 2D Gesture Generator
*   **Tech:** PyTorch, MediaPipe, GRU
*   Generated 2D stick-figure animations from text using a **<100-sample** short-video dataset.
*   Built a pipeline with **MediaPipe** keypoint extraction, **GRU** pose prediction, and text-to-motion animation.

## Course Projects (Computer Vision & GenAI)

### Medical Image Deblurring
*   **Tech:** Scale-recurrent network, Spatial-asymmetric attention
*   Mitigated motion blur in multi-modal medical images (**30% of scans affected**) to improve diagnostics.
*   Improved clarity by **24% (PSNR)**, providing higher-quality inputs for reliable medical analysis.

### Learning with Noisy Labels using Vision Transformer (ViT)
*   Classified images with **40% label noise** on CIFAR-100 by applying the state-of-the-art **Turtle method**.
*   Achieved **83% accuracy** with a Vision Transformer, maintaining strong performance despite noise.

### Fine-Grained Classification on CUB Dataset
*   Designed a CNN with **<10M parameters**, achieving **35% lower model size** with competitive accuracy.
*   Attained **87.14% top-1 accuracy** on 200 bird species.

### Autoencoding Beyond Pixels
*   Implemented **VAE/GAN** to generate high-fidelity images, improving perceptual score by **18%** over SOTA.
*   Achieved superior fidelity via **latent space arithmetic** on 10K+ images.

## Achievements
